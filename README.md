# BLOCKCHAIN USED:
- Celler:
- Cocos:
- Matic
- Ropsten

### Learning the gaming and exploring all new blockchain platforms were more challenging
### Cocos is an awsome platfomr but the instructions in cocos was in chinese and we had to use google lens to translate multiple sentences
### Celler is very interesting platfomr but there is lack of documentation on integrating celerX with various gaming frameworks/engines. 
### Ropsten was lacking and more the 3000 blocks were in queue. web3js version backward incompatibilty was causing issues
### ethere-js has a bug which is already reported and took much time
### Faced many issues integrating web3 latest version with Matic and had to move go-eth client. we have spend more time in integrating with Matic and transaction were not mining.
